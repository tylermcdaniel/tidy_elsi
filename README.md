# tidy_elsi
The Urban Insitute's Education Data package is a terrific resource for loading school and district data into R (https://github.com/UrbanInstitute/education-data-package-r). However, not all variables are available, so sometimes it is necessary to download these from ELSI (https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/elsi/tableGenerator.aspx). Tidying these files and incorporating them into R can be a real pain. 

The purpose of this code  is to read data files from ELSI into R. This code should be used once you have downloaded a data file from ELSI. Please pay careful attention to the formatting query requirements - these are a bit tedious, but the package will save you some time if used correctly. Examples to come.
